# GPT-BOT-nodejs

The "GPT-BOT-nodejs" repository offers a Node.js application for a conversational bot using the GPT model. To work with this application, make sure you have Node version 18.12.1 or newer and npm installed.

For smoother development, you can globally install the "nodemon" package by executing the command npm i nodemon -g. Once it's installed, you can initiate the application using npm run dev. This leverages "nodemon" to automatically restart the server whenever you're working on it. Alternatively, you can launch the application without "nodemon" using npm start


# ----npm install
# ----npm start 

Please make sure to replace the placeholder key in the .env file with your actual key before using the application.
